#### Play [Muggle Mischief](https://mandajoan.github.io/mandajoan.muggle-mischief.io/)
 ### Game Overview:

>This game includes 3 challenges, and a Sudden Death round in the event of a tie. Though prior knowledge of the Harry Potter narrative is not necessary to play, this game is oriented toward fans of the series.
>> The first Challenge, "Find the Golden Snitch", requires each player to use the computer mouse to scan the Quidditch field for the hiding snitch. The player able to locate the snitch, via moving their mouse over its hidden location, in the shortest amount of time is the winner of the challenge.
>>
>> In second Challenge, "Tic-Tac-Troll", the players face off against each other in direct play. Tic-Tac-Troll requires four blocks in a winning pattern, rather than the traditional three. The first to align four trolls is the winner of this challenge. In the event of a cat's game, the reset button will reset the game board and the players can try again.
>>
>> The third challenge, "Ravenclaw's Tower", give each player an opportunity to answer the same riddle. Getting the wrong answer deducts a point from the player's score, while a correct answer adds a point. In the event that the two player's scores are tied by the end of Ravenclaw's Tower challenge, a tie breaking challenge will be made accessible.
>>
>> For the SUDDEN DEATH CHALLENGE, the players face off against each other once again. The winner of this challenge must click their answer box first and submit the correct answer to the provided question in the prompt. The players must act fast as the first to click their box, and yes, there may be some elbows thrown in this challenge. If the player who answers first is incorrect the other player gets the opportunity to answer. If that player answers incorrectly, the game ends in a tie.
