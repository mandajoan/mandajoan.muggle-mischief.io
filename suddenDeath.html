      <p> Upon clicking start a picture will appear.<br>
      The player who clicks their respective button first<br>
      and correctly identify the subject of the picture is the winner of the game.<br>
      If you click first but answer incorrectly, you will not be able to try again <br>
      and the other player will be allowed a turn. <br>
      If the second player to answer does so correctly, they are the winner of the game.<br>
      If both players answer incorrectly, both lose the game and it ends with no winner.
        <br>
        <br>
      Ideally both of players would place their hands in their laps after click start, <br>
      as there is a short delay to ensure no unfair advantage to the player who clicks start.<br>
      But this game is called MUGGLE MISCHIEF, so do what you want but you are responsible for <br>
      any injuries or hurt feelings.
