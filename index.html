<p id="instructionsP">This is a game built for mischievous muggles who dream of playing in the wizard world.
  Go ahead and grab a friend, as this is a two muggle game. There are three challenges & the winner is the muggle
  who gets the best out of three. The first & last challenges are scored by best time & are played individually.
  The players compete against each other in the second, & the winner is the first to match three in a row.
  <br>
  <br>
Alright, you filthy muggles, enjoy the game & get up to some mischief.
<br>
Cheeky insults & cheating encouraged.

  <h1> &#x2728; Wizard's Tic-Tac-Troll</h1>
    <p id="challenge2P"> You may be familiar with this wizard game as the muggles adopted it from us<br>
      many years past. But don't be mistaken, Tic-Tac-Troll predates any muggle version. Rules are quite simple:<br>
      You will play against each other. First to match three trolls in a row scores a point.<br>
      <br>
      Player One begins by selecting a square. In event of a tie, click the <button id="resetButtonTtt">Reset</button> and play again. </p>

   <h1> &#x2728; Ravenclaw's Riddle</h1>
   <p id="challenge3P"> Unlike the other houses at Hogwarts, Ravenclaw's dormitory requires no password.<br>
     Instead, those who wish to enter must answer a riddle.<br> [Not sure how this prevents
     any intruders from entering, but that is clearly not my problem]<br>
     Your task here is simple, each player will have a turn to solve the same riddle.<br>
     Answering correctly will earn you a point. Answering incorrectly will deduct a point from your score. <br>
     May the sharpest mind win...
     <br>
    <br>
    Player One begins the game by clicking start. Player Two, go stare at a wall until Player One finishes.<br>
