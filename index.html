<p id="instructionsP">This is a game built for mischievous muggles who dream of playing in the wizard world.
  Go ahead and grab a friend, as this is a two muggle game. There are three challenges & the winner is the muggle
  who gets the best out of three. The first & last challenges are scored by best time & are played individually.
  The players compete against each other in the second, & the winner is the first to match three in a row.
  <br>
  <br>
Alright, you filthy muggles, enjoy the game & get up to some mischief.
<br>
Cheeky insults & cheating encouraged.

  <h1> &#x2728; Wizard's Tic-Tac-Troll</h1>
    <p id="challenge2P"> You may be familiar with this wizard game as the muggles adopted it from us<br>
      many years past. But don't be mistaken, Tic-Tac-Troll predates any muggle version. Rules are quite simple:<br>
      You will play against each other. First to match three trolls in a row wins a point.<br>
      <br>
      Player One begins by selecting a square. In event of a tie, click the <button class="resetButton">Reset</button> and play again. </p>

 <div id="challenge3">
   <h1> &#x2728; Potion's Puzzle</h1>
   <p id="challenge3P"> Snape's foul reputation likely stretches even into the muggle world, so you <br>
    very well may already know that failing this challenge leads to horrid consequences.<br>
    Placed in front of you are three potions bottles. One of which is the key to passing this level and<br>
    selecting this bottle will earn you a point. The other two will kill you instantly, causing<br>
    to lose two points from your score, assuming you have at least two points to lose.<br>
    May the most cunning mind win. . .<br>
    <br>
    Player One begins the game. Player Two, go stare at a wall until Player One finishes.<br>
